1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,599
Things sure have changed. Not everyone

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,840
believes it, but the bad guys went good.

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,400
And we cannot wait for society to

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,440
welcome us with open arms. Aren't you a

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,240
notorious criminal? Yes. No. Maybe.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,320
Sorry. Sorry. Nerves. It hasn't been

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,400
easy with a reputation like ours. You

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,240
want to work at a bank? Why not? Some of

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,599
my best memories are at banks. You

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,599
robbed us three times. Duh. That was

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,040
this bank.

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,200
How are we supposed to get a fresh start

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,320
if no one will trust us? I'm keeping my

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,600
eye on you guys. What? What was that? I

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,520
panicked. Okay, I'm a panicer.

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,200
The name's Kitty and these are my

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,000
associates. So, you're like the bad

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,640
girl. We need the bad guys for the

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,640
biggest heist in history. Maybe you

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:58,000
don't keep up with the news, but we're

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:00,000
good now. I'm not exactly asking.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Don't tell me you guys are bad again.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,920
No, we're being set up. We need to show

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,479
the world we're good. So, we're going to

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,400
sabotage him.

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,080
All right, Mr. Master of Disguise,

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,600
you're up. I promise to play you

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,600
respectfully. My

29
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:18,560
flowers, do your thing. I'll be your

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,080
hacker today. Snake, we're going to need

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,400
some extra muscle. I'm late for a

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,040
venyasa. Venyasa. You think I got this

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,040
body by sitting around watching TV? And

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,920
then we just have to tear them apart

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,000
limb by limb until all they can remember

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,000
is pain.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,360
Wow. Okay. I was going to say stop him,

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,680
but sure. If there's time, we can do the

39
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,680
limb thing.

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,439
First time for everything, right?

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,920
Pull us up, snake

42
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,240
vignasa,

43
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:03,119
baby. Come on.

44
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,000
Are you kidding me? Lefty loosey, righty

45
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,960
tighty.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,960
Oh, right.

47
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,720
You're not nervous, right? Cuz we know

48
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,560
what happens when you're nervous, buddy.

49
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:22,560
I'm sorry. What? No. No. No.

50
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:25,560
No. Help me. Stay with me, B. Stay with

51
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,560
me.

52
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,920
Racing is my dream.

53
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,400
I could race in the Grand Prix and I

54
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,920
could win. You'll get your chance to

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,480
race someday. He is the fourtime Grand

56
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,640
Prix champion.

57
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,959
It's Ed's car.

58
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:54,360
This is unhealthy.

59
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,360
Stop. Get out of my car. Okay. And

60
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:02,720
[Applause]

61
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:06,360
your arms like a noodle. I'm over here.

62
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,360
There's your arm.

63
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:14,080
It's not broken. No driving for a few

64
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:17,200
weeks. Weeks. I have an idea. We look

65
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,800
alike. I could take your place. Also,

66
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,239
you give me half the prize money or

67
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,760
there's no deal. All right, deal. I

68
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,760
can't believe I'm going to drive in the

69
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,800
Grand Prix.

70
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,840
Neither can I.

71
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,080
Welcome to the Grand Prix. I must be

72
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,400
dreaming.

73
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,360
Nice driving.

74
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,920
Be careful. One mistake can cost you.

75
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,640
That was totally a threat. I still

76
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,000
really want his autograph, though.

77
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,000
He's completely lost control.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,799
Maybe my dream should have stayed a

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,640
dream. I believe in you, Ed. You've got

80
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,640
this.

81
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,640
Watch this. This is unbelievable.

Are you ready to get pumped up?

85
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:31,600
Hello everyone. I have big news. I found

86
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,720
Smurf Village. I'm one step closer to

87
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:38,160
total evil

88
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:41,639
dominance. Lame. You're all lame.

89
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,639
Hit it, papa.

I

92
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:03,479
think

93
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:03,479
it feel like a friend.

94
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,960
What the smurf?

95
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,680
No, I think I just smurfed my pants.

96
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,000
Code blue

97
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,440
from Paramount Pictures. We got to

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,240
rescue Papa. Let me guess. Papa Smurf's

99
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,280
in trouble.

100
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,680
We are storming Rosamel's castle and we

101
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,000
take no prisoners except for Papa. We'll

102
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,759
make sure and grab him. Everybody know

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,759
the game to do. We're going to need help

104
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,759
from

105
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:44,160
the Snood Poots. Snutder Poots.

106
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:46,639
Hey, what are they saying?

107
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,320
this July. If we don't stop these

108
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,160
wizards,

109
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:56,680
it'll mean the end of the universe.

110
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,680
Sound effect. Smurf, can you back off?

111
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Let's go smurf that wizard up. Oh, yeah.

112

Get ready. Race for impact for an

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,240
Hold on, you little Smurf.

117
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:22,199
We're here to save everything. Goodbye,

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,199
Smurfves. Forever.

119
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:35,800
Now that's what I call a banger. Smurfs

120
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,800
featuring new music by Rihanna and more.

121
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,960
It's a new day. We're taking a trip to

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,880
spend the week with my grandma.

Buckle up, Gabby Catch. It's time to go.

Here we go.

125
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,960
Do you want to come to San Francisco

The

129
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,680

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,479
we're moving.

that?

What do we have here? Vera wondered

136
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,400
aloud as a man in the street yelled at

137
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,400
her. Seriously, lady, what is wrong with

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,400
you?

139
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:51,759
This dollhouse will complete my cat

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:54,319

It's time to get tiny. Let's get this

dragons is wrong.
